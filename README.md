# mw-api
API to use the WiFi capabilities of the MegaWiFi cartridges.

This is work in progress. Right now only a few capabilities are working, and the main source file contains dirty code used for testing purposes.

# Building
You will need a complete Genesis/Megadrive toolchain. You will also need SGDK for building the tests/examples (although it is not needed to build the library).
